<h2> TrashTron | <a href="https://www.reubotics.com/#/interns/">Reubotics</a> </h2>

<h3> November 2023 - November 2024</h3>

<div style="text-align:justify">Designed (using Onshape's CAD software), assembled, machined, and programmed a Robot (named <b>TrashTron</b>) with the guidance of the Robotics Subject Matter Expert, Dr. Reuben Brewer. 
TrashTron is a mobile robot with a gripper-arm that autonomously detects, moves to, and picks up plastic trash bottles lying on the ground.</div> <br>

<ul>
<li>Used Dynamixel AX-18A and XC-330 Motors for this project. Setup communication to motors through the Pyserial module, given the packet length, instruction packets, parity, etc.</li>
<li>Parts used to make TrashTron included 8mm shafts, flanged ball bearings, clamping shaft collars, shims, and an assortment of socket head screws. Tools used included Allen wrenches, hand taps, reamers, and a hand drill. All main parts were 3-D printed on a Bambu Lab X1 Carbon printer.</li>
<li>Stress-tested the design in the CAD software (Onshape) and calculated expected torque on the motor. This was used to make the gear ratios torque-oriented.</li>
 <li>Cut, re-lengthened, and soldered wires in order to make the wires fit my design. Additionally, I tested the power distribution of my wiring using a multimeter.</li>
<li>Wrote a program using Computer Vision concepts to train a custom Machine Learning Model (YOLOv5 Object Detection Model) to help TrashTron detect, move to, and pick up the plastic trash bottle.</li>
</ul>

<h2> Automated Detection of Vehicles for the Visually Impaired to Cross Roads	         				       </h2>
<h3>August 2023 - June 2025</h3>
<ul>
<li>Recognizing the limitations of existing apps designed for crosswalks, this research focuses on developing an innovative solutionâ€”
a mobile app that utilizes computer vision to detect moving cars on the road 
and alerts users through vibrations about the safety of crossing. </li>
<li>The ultimate goal of this project was to contribute valuable insights into the feasibility and benefits of such technology,
 paving the way for future advancements in assisting visually impaired individuals in crossing residential roads safely. </li>
<li>I built an app and tested the object detection model in different scenarios, analyzed successful detections and detection failures, and deployed on smart-hats.</li>
<li>Accepted and Presented at the <a href="https://foothill.edu/rsl-symposium/2024-program.html">Foothill College Research & Service Leadership Symposium (RSLS) May 2024</a>: "Automated Detection of Cars for the Visually Impaired to Cross Roads"</li>
