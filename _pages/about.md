My name is Sangeet, which means music in Sanskrit. Sound waves, as they ebb and flow, vibrate in our eardrums, making mellifluous music. Looking back now, I discover that I resonate deeply with a myriad of waves. These harmonize my life, synthesizing a magnificent melody. 
<br><br>
Growing up, I found myself exploring sine waves in trigonometry, experimenting with light waves in chemistry, and learning about quantum mechanical waves in physics. Drawing confidence from this foundation, I have tackled multiple challenges in electronics, engineering, and robotics. Be it radio waves at Verizon, mechanical waves at Reubotics, or wave-like time series data at Google, I have built strong technical expertise across coursework, internships, projects, and research. At the same time, I have gained proficiency in various programming languages, earning 5 certifications at Foothill College. Leveraging these skills, I am eager to dive deeper during my future undergraduate studies. I aim to become a mechatronics engineer--whose practical actions and creative works make waves for generations to come.

Other than abstract waves, I spend my free time in actual waves. I was a competitive swimmer from 2010 to 2020--at Bangalore's Nisha Millets Swim Academy, then at Palo Alto's PASA and Alto Swim Clubs. A day out on the water is always invigorating, be it when I am ocean kayaking, canoeing, whitewater rafting, small boat sailing, swimming, or diving (as someone PADI certified for Open Water Diving). At this point, I have visited nearly every beach along the California coast!
