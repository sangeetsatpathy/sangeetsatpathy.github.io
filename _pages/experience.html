<h2> Robotics Intern (Personal Project) - Creator of TrashTron | <a href="https://www.reubotics.com/#/interns/">Reubotics</a> </h2>

<h3> November 2023 - Present</h3>

<div style="text-align:justify">Designed (using Onshape's CAD software), assembled, machined, and programmed a Robot (named <b>TrashTron</b>) with the guidance of the Robotics Subject Matter Expert, Dr. Reuben Brewer. 
TrashTron detects, moves to, and picks up plastic trash bottles lying on the ground.</div> <br>
<div style="width:560px; height:316px">
<iframe width="178%" height="100%" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8wo4DTQ7WL4?si=zhz7DXyHIy3SCeGf" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Used Dynamixel AX-18A and XC-330 Motors for this project. Setup communication to motors through the Pyserial module, given the packet length, instruction packets, parity, etc.</li>
<li>Parts used to make TrashTron included 8mm shafts, flanged ball bearings, clamping shaft collars, shims, and an assortment of socket head screws. Tools used included Allen wrenches, hand taps, reamers, and a hand drill. All main parts were 3-D printed on a Bambu Lab X1 Carbon printer.</li>
<li>Stress-tested the design in the CAD software (Onshape) and calculated expected torque on the motor. This was used to make the gear ratios torque-oriented.</li>
 <li>Cut, re-lengthened, and soldered wires in order to make the wires fit my design. Additionally, I tested the power distribution of my wiring using a multimeter.</li>
<li>Wrote a program using Computer Vision concepts to train a custom Machine Learning Model (YOLOv5 Object Detection Model) to help TrashTron detect, move to, and pick up the plastic trash bottle.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<b>Skills:</b> Mechanical Design, CAD (Computer-Aided Design), Kinematics, Trigonometry, Python, Computer Vision, Object Detection, PID Control, Electrical Wiring & Soldering

<h2>Radio Frequency (Wireless Networks) Engineering Intern  | <a href="https://www.verizon.com/home/internet/">Verizon</a>     
   <br> (Through the <a href="https://naf.org/our-academies/career-pathways/academy-of-engineering/">NAF Academy of Engineering internship</a> program)               </h2>
<h3>Jun 2024 – July 2024</h3>
<ul>
<li>Analyzed the performance of Verizon's 5G Fixed Wireless Access (FWA) Products (on C-band) in several counties in Northern California. Verizon's Fixed Wireless Access product,
 also known as 5G Home Internet, provides 5G internet access without needing a cabled connection to one's house.</li>
<li>Troubleshooted and resolved issues such as slow internet speeds, high drop rates, and radio frequency 
interference at 5G sites, which resulted in better Internet experiences for customers. 
Issues included an incorrectly built cell site, an overshooting antenna tilt, or a synchronization issue.</li>
<li>Worked on the steps that go into planning, building, and maintaining a cell site. 
These included cell site design (simulating antenna coverage based on power, height, and azimuth), power regulation, safety inspection (Electromagnetic Exposure), municipal engagement, and system performance.
 Additionally, I learnt about the difference between 5G SA (Standalone) and 5G NSA (Non Stand Alone), TDD (Time Division Duplexing) vs. FDD (Frequency Division Duplexing), Cell Site Guard Periods, as well as Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM).
</li>
</ul>
This internship was for 6 weeks (32 hours per week).

<h2> Machinist, CAD Designer, Curriculum Lead, Publicity Lead | <a href='https://www.gunnrobotics.com/'>Gunn Robotics Team (GRT)</a>       			      </h2>
<h3> Aug 2023 - Present</h3>
<div style="text-align: justify;">The Gunn Robotics Team (FRC 192), is a completely student-run team that participates in the annual First Robotics Competition Challenge. When in off-season, the team participates in various community outreach events, such as building a “Haunted House” for Juana Briones elementary school. We design, CAD and  machine wooden Halloween-themed mechanisms that are powered by pneumatics i.e. build moving contraptions, such as ghosts popping out from the house, skeleton petting a styrofoam cat, and more.</div>

    <summary><b>Machinist & CAD Designer</b></summary>
<ul>
<li>On the team, I am an active leader in strategizing and brainstorming our robots for optimal scoring efficiency, reliability, and ease of control.</li>
<li>To test my innovative solutions, I develop and test prototypes - using 3D-printed, laser-cut, and wooden parts - to analyze the benefits and setbacks of each design.</li>
<li>Upon finalizing our robot designs, I develop precise CAD (Computer-Aided Design) models of the robot parts to visualize our mechanisms before we start building.</li> 
<li>Using machines such as the CNC, lathe, mill, drill press, vertical bandsaw (wood and metal), and horizontal bandsaw, I cut metal stock down to specified dimensions
 to create the robotics parts we designed on the CAD software. </li>
<li>After helping assemble, wire, and program the robot, I am pivotal in providing critical feedback during the testing phases to enhance robot performance.</li>
</ul>

 My contributions and my team's efforts culminated in a first-place victory at the <a href="https://frc-events.firstinspires.org/2024/IDBO/awards">March 2024 FIRST Robotics Competition Idaho Regional</a>, securing us a spot at the 2024 World Championship.

 <details>   <summary><b>Curriculum Lead</b></summary>


As a Curriculum Lead for the <a href='https://www.gunnrobotics.com/summer'>2024 GRT Summer Camp </a>, I developed the curriculum for the camp. This included making a list of concepts and developing robotics challenges for the participants to learn from.
<br><br>

<details>   <summary><b>Publicity Lead</b></summary>

<div style="text-align: justify;">Historically, GRT has been known to be extremely competitive in its admissions, as the number of applicants have been significantly greater than the number of available positions. However, GRT Applications from within our school were significantly lower this past academic year (2023-2024).  As a result, this unique position was created in order for GRT to have a significant on-campus presence. As the Publicity Lead, I am responsible for strategizing, deciding, and implementing the next course of action to make our team an integral part of Gunn. This includes:</div>
<ul>
    <li>Coordinating with the Student Executive Council and Student Activities Director to market our team.     </li>
    <li>Planning and conducting social media publicity campaigns</li>
    <li>Reshaping the brand awareness of GRT</li>
    <li>Building partnerships with other organizations on campus</li>
</ul>
