<h2>Radio Frequency (Wireless Networks) Engineering Intern  | <a href="https://www.verizon.com/home/internet/">Verizon</a>     
   <br> (Through the <a href="https://naf.org/our-academies/career-pathways/academy-of-engineering/">NAF Academy of Engineering internship</a> program)               </h2>
<h3>June 2024 – July 2024</h3>
<ul>
<li>Analyzed the performance of Verizon's 5G Fixed Wireless Access (FWA) Products (on C-band) in several counties in Northern California. Verizon's Fixed Wireless Access product,
 also known as 5G Home Internet, provides 5G internet access without needing a cabled connection to one's house.</li>
<li>Troubleshooted and resolved issues such as slow internet speeds, high drop rates, and radio frequency 
interference at 5G sites, which resulted in better Internet experiences for customers. 
Issues included an incorrectly built cell site, an overshooting antenna tilt, or a synchronization issue.</li>
<li>Worked on the steps that go into planning, building, and maintaining a cell site. 
These included cell site design (simulating antenna coverage based on power, height, and azimuth), power regulation, safety inspection (Electromagnetic Exposure), municipal engagement, and system performance.
 Additionally, I learnt about the difference between 5G SA (Standalone) and 5G NSA (Non Stand Alone), TDD (Time Division Duplexing) vs. FDD (Frequency Division Duplexing), Cell Site Guard Periods, as well as Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM).
</li>
</ul>
Sole intern from PAUSD. This internship was for 6 weeks (32 hours per week).

<h2> Machinist, CAD Designer, Curriculum Lead, Publicity Lead | <a href='https://www.gunnrobotics.com/'>Gunn Robotics Team (GRT)</a>       			      </h2>
<h3> August 2023 - June 2025</h3>
<div style="text-align: justify;">The Gunn Robotics Team (FRC 192), is a completely student-run team that participates in the annual First Robotics Competition Challenge. </div>

<details>
    <summary><b>Machinist & CAD Designer</b></summary>
<ul>
<li>On the team, I am an active leader in strategizing and brainstorming our robots for optimal scoring efficiency, reliability, and ease of control.</li>
<li>To test my innovative solutions, I develop and test prototypes - using 3D-printed, laser-cut, and wooden parts - to analyze the benefits and setbacks of each design.</li>
<li>Upon finalizing our robot designs, I develop precise CAD (Computer-Aided Design) models of the robot parts to visualize our mechanisms before we start building.</li> 
<li>Using machines such as the CNC, lathe, mill, drill press, vertical bandsaw (wood and metal), and horizontal bandsaw, I cut metal stock down to specified dimensions
 to create the robotics parts we designed on the CAD software. </li>
<li>After helping assemble, wire, and program the robot, I am pivotal in providing critical feedback during the testing phases to enhance robot performance.</li>
</ul>

 My contributions and my team's efforts culminated in a first-place victory at the <a href="https://frc-events.firstinspires.org/2024/IDBO/awards">March 2024 FIRST Robotics Competition Idaho Regional</a>, securing us a spot at the 2024 World Championship.

 <details>   <summary><b>Curriculum Lead</b></summary>

<ul>
<li>As a Curriculum Lead for the <a href='https://www.gunnrobotics.com/summer'>2024 GRT Summer Camp </a>, I developed an introductory curriculum with concepts spanning robotics, computer science, engineering, and math. </li>
<li>This curriculum was taught at the Summer Camp and helped incoming 9th graders decide to learn engineering in high school.</li>
<li>I also designed and guided camp participants through fun robotics challenges where they applied their learning.</li>
</ul>
</details>



<details>   <summary><b>Publicity Lead</b></summary>

<div style="text-align: justify;">Historically, GRT has been known to be extremely competitive in its admissions, as the number of applicants have been significantly greater than the number of available positions. However, GRT Applications from within our school were significantly lower this past academic year (2023-2024).  As a result, this unique position was created in order for GRT to have a significant on-campus presence. As the Publicity Lead, I am responsible for strategizing, deciding, and implementing the next course of action to make our team an integral part of Gunn. This includes:</div>
<ul>
    <li>Coordinating with the Student Executive Council and Student Activities Director to market our team.     </li>
    <li>Planning and conducting social media publicity campaigns</li>
    <li>Reshaping the brand awareness of GRT</li>
    <li>Building partnerships with other organizations on campus</li>
    <li>Designing and running robot showcases, such as the "T-shirt Launcher" (which shoots T-shirts into the audience), during school events. </li>

    <summary><b>Haunted House Mechanisms (October 2023 and October 2024)</b></summary>
    During off-season, the team participates in various community outreach events, such as building a “Haunted House” for an elementary school. 
    We design, CAD and  machine wooden Halloween-themed mechanisms that are powered by pneumatics.
    These mechanisms include ghosts popping out from the house, skeletons petting styrofoam cats, moving creepers, and more.

    <summary><b>Shop Project Robot</b></summary>
    Before the competition season, GRT hosts a "Shop Project" competition, in which both of the GRT classes compete against each other in a FIRST-style mini robotics competition. This helps the team practice for the competition season.
    My shop project robot used a funnel to intake game pieces and used pneumatics to transfer the pieces into the shooter. The one-wheeled flywheel shooter had a ramp designed to launch the note at a precise angle into the scoring objective.
