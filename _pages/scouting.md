<h2>Boy Scouts of America Leadership (August 2018-April 2025)</h2>
<a href="https://troop37losaltos.com">Troop 37</a> is one of the larger troops within the <a href="https://pacsky.org/">Pacific Skyline Council</a> and is completely Scout-run.
I served continuously in various leadership roles within the troop; troop leadership positions had a lot of responsibilities and work associated with them due to the size of our troop. Troop 37 Leadership terms are 6 months long, with the exception of Den Chiefs that have a 10-month term.

Den chiefs are Boy Scouts who assist a Cub Scout den leader. They help den meetings by leading activities, games, and ceremonies and are good role models for the Cub Scouts. In addition, Den Chiefs help Cub Scouts advance through their ranks and encourage them to join a Boy Scout Troop upon graduating from Cub Scouts. <br><br>

As a part of the Bernard Harris Supernova Award, Scouts must complete two "activity topics" of their choice.

I chose to pursue activity topics in the fields of Science and Mathematics.

<div style="text-align: justify;">
<details>
<summary><b><i>Plastic Recycling (Science Activity Topic)</i></b></summary>
For my Science Activity topic, I focused on plastic recycling -- specifically, I looked into the recycling of tires and plastic toys. I learnt about the process and analyzed the impact of properly recycling these products. For the second part of the activity topic, I looked into the feasibility of recycling single-use plastics to be used as paper. Upon researching other solutions, I found an Indian-based company that had been working on fusing plastics with cotton fibers to form paper that absorbs ink. However, the problem with this is that there is no economic incentive to choose this kind of paper over tree-based paper. Since feasibility is established, further research into this kind of product is worthwhile.

<details>
<summary><b><i>Data Inference for Old Faithful Eruptions (Math Activity Topic)</i></b></summary>
For my Mathematics Activity Topic, I focused on analyzing data on past Old Faithful Geyser eruptions to perform data inference on the next eruption. Using graphing tools such as Desmos, I was able to generate a mathematical prediction of the eruption cycles.
